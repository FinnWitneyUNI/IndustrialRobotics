Our project features a two-robot system designed to simulate human hands for the purpose of making sandwiches. The UR3e robot acts as one hand, placing slices of bread, cheese, and vegetables, while a **KUKA IIWA** mimics the other hand, slicing ingredients and spreading condiments like butter or mustard. Together, they simulate the dexterity and precision of human hands to assemble a sandwich. Safety features, such as collision detection and emergency stops, are integrated to ensure safe operation. The system is ideal for home kitchens or small caf√©s, offering a customizable sandwich-making process through a user-friendly interface.
